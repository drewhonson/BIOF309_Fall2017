Course Description
------------------

This
course is designed for non-programmers,
biologists, or those without specific
knowledge of Python to learn how to program.
Week by week we will slowly build
up your skills and understanding of programming and the Python language. There
will be in class
demonstrations, using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html),
activities to be completed outside of class, mostly using
[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), and homework for you to practice and learn
at your own pace.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this
course you should be able to:
1. Look at a task and determine if you can or
should automate it
2. Create working Python programs
3. Understand the
difference between Python object types (i.e. lists, dicts)
4. Perform data
analysis and visualization with Python
5. Use git for version control and
collaboration
6. Demonstrate your Python skills with a project

Logistics
---------

This is a one-semester course starting on the 11th
of September 2017
and finishing on 18th of December 2017.

**Class Location: Rathskeller, Building
60, NIH Bethesda campus**

Attendance in class is strongly recommended; however,
we realize other
commitments will occasionally prevent attendance.
If you miss a
class, please review the materials available at the course [github
repository](https://github.com/marskar/BIO309_Fall2017) and keep up with
activities and homework.

You may only attend the section for which you signed
up.
Do **NOT** attend other sections **UNLESS** given permission to do so by the
instructor.

Most classes will have hands-on tutorials and assignments.
Both
practice and graded assignments will generally be provided.
Graded assignments
should be submitted prior to the following class.
So that you can follow along
during class, bringing a laptop to each class is strongly encouraged.

Important dates:
* September 11 : Class starts
* September 11 September 29 : Late
Registration ($10.00 late registration fee per course applies)
* October 6 :
Last day to drop/withdraw
* November 10 : Last day to change status (credit or
audit)
* December 18 : Class ends

Required Materials
------------------

**Each student is encouraged to bring their own
laptop to each class.**

*Programing
without a computer would be an exceptional
feat.*

For the course, we will use
Python 3.
Any Python installation should work, but you must be able to install
packages.
The [Anaconda Scientific Python
Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) from Continuum Analytics will
likely be the easiest approach to configuring Python, if you do not already have
Python installed.
The Anaconda installer will automatically install many of the
packages we will use during the course, including [Jupyter
Notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html).
For more information, see the guidelines on the [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to
Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/).

In addition, we will use
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com) for version control
and collaboration.

All of the course materials are available on GitHub. Before
accessing the [course materials
repo](https://github.com/marskar/BIOF309_Fall2017), you should that
1. it is likely to be be under constant development throughout the semester and
2. you are not expected to work through every single Jupyter Notebook contained therein!

We will discuss the most interesting examples during class and point out the others to be reviewed outside of class.

Most homework assignments will be managed by [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com). The list of
assignments is as follows:
01. [Hello World!](https://classroom.github.com/a/44MTt0SY)
02. [GC Percent](https://classroom.github.com/a/XrlyUiUr)
03. [Loop Example](https://classroom.github.com/a/DumKeNjl)
04. [Conditionals Example](https://classroom.github.com/a/VzDLNQbH)
05. [Cubed Program](https://classroom.github.com/a/iUdDBNnA)
06. [NumPy Problem Set](https://classroom.github.com/a/t0t2h8P0)
07. [Pandas Problem Set](https://classroom.github.com/a/MGTf6Xdb)
08. [Make A Plot](https://classroom.github.com/a/YFjKLk76)
09. [Machine Learning Example](https://classroom.github.com/a/qmS_iZJm)
10. [Final Project](https://classroom.github.com/a/oOdW4qG-)

Last but certainly not least, the very nice folks at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) have given us access to their awesome teaching materials.

The DataCamp assignments are:

01. [Python Basics](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/chapter-1-python-basics)

Optional Materials
------------------

[GitHub](https://github.com) is offering some free
awesome resources to students, that
might be of interest to you, depending on
your background: [GitHub student pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

In
particular, the [Atom](https://atom.io) text editor is noteworthy
because of its
[integration with Git and GitHub](https://github.atom.io/), and
ability to offer
[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html)-style functionality through the awesome [Hydrogen](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/) package.

The [Hydrogen](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/) package is made by the very fine people responsible for [nteract](https://nteract.io/), a desktop application that can edit and run [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html). The advantages include open [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html) by double clicking, not need to launch a [Notebook server](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html#notebook-app)

If you spend a lot of time writing Python code in [Atom](https://atom.io), you might want to try the [autocomplete-python](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python) package with [Jedi](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi)-powered autocompletion (I do **not** recommend not the [Kite](https://kite.com/) option).

You may, however, use another text editor, if you prefer.

Recommended Books
-----------------
**There is no required textbook for this course.**

We do, however, highly
recommend [Python for Data
Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) and its companion
text [A Whirlwind Tour of
Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython).
Both books are
available free on GitHub in Jupyter Notebook form.
For maximum enjoyment,
consider reading the relevant chapters before coming to class.

We will link to
relevant online resources throughout the course.

If you would like additional
material on the basics, the following resources may be useful:

* [Python for
Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/) by Martin Jones; an archived PDF
may be found in this repo in the extras folder under the name p4b.pdf.
* [Learn
Python the Hard Way (ebook freely available from the
author)](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed A. Shaw; a [video
course](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) is also available.
